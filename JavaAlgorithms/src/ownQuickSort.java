/*
 * Why?
 * Quicksort is one of the most applicable sorting algorithms out there. It runs at worst cast O(n^2) 
 * however it averages O(nlogn) which is why this is a suitable algorithm. Furthermore it only uses 
 * space complexity of O(1). 
 * 
 * When designing an algorithm it shouldn't be too complex. Quicksort is a few more lines than
 * bubble sort, therefore making it applicable to code and debug as well.
